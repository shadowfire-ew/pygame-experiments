tilesets contain groups of 80x80 tiles

list of tilesets:
- lab

tilesets layouts:
- floors sets:
    - hole
    - water
    - floor
    - wall middle
    - wall south
    - wall east
    - wall north
    - wall west

wall middle will take place in the tile
each direction of wall will have transparency
this will let me overlay the various directions where wall tiles touch non-wall tiles (eventually)
