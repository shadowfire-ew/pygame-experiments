this folder contains paths for npc's which may have movement paths
some npc's might have multiple paths

these will be saved by name as well
if  a character.char file specifies a move action, but no path is defined for the named instance, it will simply not move
likewise, defining a path for a character that cannot move will be pointless

each path is defined as a series of actions
- movement directions: where the number is how many tiles are moved
- wait: where the number is how many seconds

when a path is completed, the character will return to it's origin
I will try for shortest path
no pathfinding yet, but i will need it once i put some walls for collision
once i get pathfinding, paths will be redefined into a series of co-ordinates
