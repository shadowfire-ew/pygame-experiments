this folder contains paths for npc's which may have movement paths
some npc's might have multiple paths

these will be saved by name as well
if  a character.char file specifies a move action, but no path is defined for the named instance, it will simply not move
likewise, defining a path for a character that cannot move will be pointless

each path is defined as a series of actions
- movement directions: where the number is how many tiles are moved
- wait: where the number is how many seconds
- reverse: goes bakward through the specified number of actions, taking the opposite direction
    (ignores waits and other reverses)

when a path is completed, the character will return to it's origin
