this folder contains configs for each npc and env object's inventory
it will only have inventories for those which explicitly have inventories
might also store player inventory here and have the player's inventory be saved when sessions finish

each inventory will be saved by name
they may or may not be saved when changed by the player in game. im not sure where i am going with this game
